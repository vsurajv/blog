				    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. It is the movie of the decade</h3>
				    <p>Whether you like The Dark Knight or Lord of the Rings, Avatar is already poised to be the film by which we will judge the technological advancements and storytelling demands of this decade. It's much more traditional than many of the recent sarcastic or brooding superhero films, but Avatar is distinctly of its time, from its Iraq War metaphor to its environmental messages. Not to mention the basic fact that everyone you know will be talking about this movie, and you really shouldn't </p>


					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. James Cameron shoots action better than anyone else. </h3>
				    <p>Consider all of the recent movies in which the fight scenes are cut so quickly that you can't tell if it's a kick or a punch, or war scenarios in which the only way to identify where anyone is is to look at the colour of their uniforms. Now go to Avatar, in which master action director James Cameron takes his time to bring you to Pandora so that when the time comes to fight there, you know exactly how everything is put out. Even the Na'vi, with their unusual blue visage and lack of clothing, are clearly distinguished from one another, and this isn't only due to outstanding character design; Cameron gives each one a unique weapon or beast. </p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">3.The love story really works. </h3>
				    <p>When these two start to bond while running through the forest and taming flying banshees, it's a love story that transcends distant planets and blue cat people completely. Jake may be a blank lunkhead and Neytiri a strident warrior woman. Jake and Neytiri's kisses feel real and passionate, and especially near the end, when the two are forced to fight for each other and the entire Na'vi culture, their connection is not just palpable but essential to the final third of the movie working at all. Cameron mercifully spares us the specifics of how Na'vi sex exactly operates.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">4.It's the first time 3D has actually felt important. </h3>
				    <p>Although the glasses are still big and odd-looking, you won't even notice them after five minutes of watching Avatar. Yes, digital 3D has improved over the past few years and can occasionally shock you with a joke, but until seeing Avatar, I had never tried to wipe away wayward dirt from a battlefield or recoiled involuntarily at the sight of a certain kind of wood sprite coming toward me. In Up, 3D provided Carl's flying house a lovely depth of field, and in My Bloody Valentine, it increased the tension. However, in Avatar, technology is just as significant as the motion-capture algorithms that produced Neytiri. To really comprehend it, you must see it. </p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. You've never seen anything like it before.</h3>
				    <p>It's possible that your eyes will remain the same, and many of the characters—the avaricious corporate boss, the fearsome army captain, and the steadfast hero—will be recognisable from scores of previous films you've seen. However, it scarcely matters what story surrounds the flora and wildlife of Pandora, the vibrant hues, bizarre creatures, floating mountains, and illuminating trees. In the movie, even the human technology is skillfully built on what we already have, so rather than astonishing you with inconceivable feats, Cameron amazes you by demonstrating what your MacBook should be able to accomplish. We've grown jaded at seeing the impossibly in this age of CGI.. </p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">6.  Warren Buffet</h3>
				    <p>Warren Buffet, also referred to as the Oracle of Omaha, is regarded as one of the great investors of all time. He is already in authority of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns more than 60 businesses, including such a well Geico insurer, Duracell, & Dairy Queen restaurant. He has a $110 billion net worth. He buy his first stock when he was 11 years old. He is the son of a US lawmaker. </p>
					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">7.  Larry Ellison </h3>
				    <p>Oracle, the software company he cofounded in 1977, is where Larry Ellison makes the majority of his $97 billion in net worth. He left his position as the company's CEO in 2014, and since then he has served as the board chairman and top technical advisor. In addition, Ellison joined the Tesla board in December 2018 after purchasing 3 million shares earlier in the year. He virtually owns the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai. </p>
					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">8. Mukesh Ambani  </h3>
				    <p>Petrochemicals, oil and gas, retail, and telecom are among the industries in which Reliance Industries' founder and chairman has interests. Reliance's debut of 4G phone services in the Indian telecom sector in 2016 sparked a price war that destroyed other networks' business models and created significant whirlwinds. </p>
					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">9. Larry Page </h3>
				    <p>With an estimated net worth of $81.4 billion, co-founder of Google Larry Page is the ninth richest person in the world. Along with "Flying Car," startup businesses Kitty Hawk and Opener, he has also invested in Planetary Resources, the renowned space exploration corporation. </p>
					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">10.Steve Ballmer </h3>
				    <p>Steve Ballmer, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, is the tenth richest person in the world with a net worth of $90.5 billion. Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft in 1980 and succeeded Bill Gates as its CEO in 2000.</p>
